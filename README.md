Create a folder with the java programming language in VS code.
Create a file with the name client and server separately.
The client code receives the data packets from the server of the already saved videos in the directory.(**Alter the path of the videos with your video directory path**)
The user when running the program with server and client separately, the client gets connected to the server with the localhost number which is given.
Now, the output displays the number of videos available in the server side of the code.
When input the client number and the video requested by the client the server fetches the video and serves it to the client.
The video is played in the received_video_1.mp4.
This takes up only 2 clients at a time.
